### Open University  Learng to Code for Data-Analystics
These are the Projects i did while on the bootcamp for Learn to code for Data analysis.
Taking this course was one of the Best decision I made to get into the Data Science Domain. Before attending this Bootcamp I had no idea how to use python for data analysis. I saw the use of code for analysis in a python course I attended but that time I didn’t give much of my attention I just watched the course and didn’t learn anything for data analysis because that time I didn’t cared about entering the data domain. But this course give a good starting point to keep my foot planted. The course had good quality content, Well structured and Learning was based on doing not by showing. So I have to dirty my hands to complete the course. This course was the one which I most committed, this boot camp was a routine setter for me, it help me break the pattern of studying when I feel motivated. I was able sit more hours for the learning  because the structure of the course is to solve problems so I didn’t got bored. The course was not video based, The contents for the course is Text Based and to read  you need focus then only you will the gist of it, Time just fly when I work on the course for Exercises and Projects. I have gained confidence in the analytical domain through this camp. I am grateful for the creators of the Course and making it free to learn.
